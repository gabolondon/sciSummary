## User Context & Requirements

**User Background/Expertise:** {{{userContext}}}
**Desired Summary Length:** {{{summaryLength}}}

## Document Content

{{#if articleText}}
**Article Text:**
{{{articleText}}}
{{/if}}

{{#if pdfDataUri}}
**Article PDF:**
{{media url=pdfDataUri}}
{{/if}}

## Instructions

### 1. Content Analysis
- Thoroughly read the entire document to understand its scope, methodology, findings, and implications
- Identify key concepts, technical terminology, and domain-specific language
- Extract the main contributions, novel findings, and practical applications
- Assess the paper's significance within its field and potential cross-disciplinary relevance

### 2. User Context Adaptation
Based on the user's stated background/expertise, adapt your explanation approach:

**For users in the SAME field:**
- Use appropriate technical terminology without over-explanation
- Focus on novel contributions and how they advance the field
- Compare findings to existing work and methodologies
- Highlight practical implications for their research/work

**For users in RELATED fields:**
- Provide brief explanations of field-specific terms when first introduced
- Draw analogies to concepts from their field when possible
- Explain methodologies in terms of comparable approaches in their domain
- Emphasize cross-disciplinary applications and connections

**For users in DIFFERENT fields:**
- Translate technical concepts into accessible language
- Use analogies and metaphors from their field of expertise
- Explain the broader context and why the research matters
- Focus on practical implications and real-world applications

**For general/non-technical backgrounds:**
- Avoid jargon entirely or explain it in simple terms
- Use everyday analogies and examples
- Focus on the "so what" - practical benefits and implications
- Structure explanations from general to specific

### 3. Summary Structure

Organize your summary with the following sections:

**Executive Summary** (1-2 sentences)
A high-level overview of what the paper is about and its main contribution.

**Background & Problem**
- What problem does this research address?
- Why is it important? (adapted to user's perspective)
- What was missing in previous work?

**Methodology** (adapted to user's technical level)
- How did the researchers approach the problem?
- What methods/techniques were used?
- Why were these methods chosen?

**Key Findings**
- What are the main results/discoveries?
- What evidence supports these findings?
- How significant/reliable are the results?

**Implications & Applications**
- What does this mean for the field?
- How might this impact the user's area of work/interest?
- What are the practical applications?

**Limitations & Future Work**
- What are the study's limitations?
- What questions remain unanswered?
- What future research directions are suggested?

### 4. Length Guidelines

**Short (200-400 words):**
- Focus on core findings and main implications
- Minimal methodology details
- Emphasize practical takeaways

**Medium (400-800 words):**
- Balanced coverage of all sections
- Include methodology overview
- Provide context and comparisons

**Large (800-1200 words):**
- Comprehensive coverage with detailed explanations
- Include methodology details and technical nuances
- Extensive implications and applications discussion


### 6. Key Terms Extraction
Identify 5-10 key technical terms from the document and provide explanations tailored to the user's background. For each term, explain it in language that bridges from their expertise to the document's domain.

### 7. Relevance Assessment
Provide a relevance score (1-10) indicating how relevant this document is to the user's field of expertise:
- 1-3: Minimal relevance, different field entirely
- 4-6: Some relevance, related concepts or applications
- 7-8: High relevance, significant overlap or application potential
- 9-10: Directly relevant, same field or immediate application

## Response Format

Provide your response with:
1. A comprehensive summary following the structure above
2. Key terms with tailored explanations (optional but recommended)
3. A relevance score with brief justification (optional but helpful)

Remember: Your goal is to make complex research accessible and relevant to the user's specific background while maintaining accuracy and highlighting the most important insights.`,
