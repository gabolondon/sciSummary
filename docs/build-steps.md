# Building SciSummary: A Step-by-Step Guide

This document outlines the process of building the SciSummary application, from a basic file summarizer to a polished, authenticated web app. Each step corresponds to a feature request and implementation.

---

### Step 1: Broadening File Type Acceptance

The initial version of the app only accepted text files. The first step was to make the file input more flexible.

**Prompt:** "But change the input file type, it can accept pdf, word and txt files"

**Summary:**
The file input component was updated to accept PDF (`.pdf`), Microsoft Word (`.doc`, `.docx`), and plain text (`.txt`) files. A user-friendly toast notification was added to inform users that while Word documents could be selected, they were not yet supported for summarization, managing user expectations.

*   **Key file modified:** `src/app/page.tsx`

### Step 2: Implementing PDF Summarization with AI

With PDF files now accepted, the next step was to actually process them.

**Prompt:** "Now add the ability to accept pdf files, for that, the input file should validate that the pdf file should be smaller than 5mb and use the flash model to analyze the pdf file"

**Summary:**
This was a significant update that involved both the frontend and the AI backend.

1.  **Frontend:** A client-side validation was added to ensure uploaded PDF files are under 5MB.
2.  **Backend (AI Flow):** The Genkit flow (`summarize-article-flow.ts`) was enhanced. It can now receive PDF files as a Base64-encoded data URI. The prompt was updated to instruct the Gemini Flash model on how to process the `pdfDataUri` input.

*   **Key files modified:** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/ai/flows/summarize-article-flow.ts`

### Step 3: Securing the App with Firebase Authentication

To create a user-specific experience and protect the application, Firebase Authentication was integrated.

**Prompt:** "now implement firebase auth to this app"

**Summary:**
A comprehensive authentication system was added, transforming the app into a multi-user platform.

1.  **Firebase Setup:** A Firebase client was configured (`src/lib/firebase/client.ts`) and environment variables were added to a new `.env.local` file to securely store Firebase project credentials.
2.  **UI/UX:** New pages were created for `login` and `signup`, featuring forms for email/password and a "Sign in with Google" option.
3.  **State Management:** A React Context (`src/context/auth-context.tsx`) was created to manage the user's authentication state globally across the app.
4.  **Protected Routes:** The main summarizer page was converted into a protected route. It now checks if a user is logged in; if not, it redirects them to the login page.

*   **New files created:**
    *   `src/app/login/page.tsx`
    *   `src/app/signup/page.tsx`
    *   `src/context/auth-context.tsx`
    *   `src/lib/firebase/client.ts`
    *   `.env.local` (with placeholder values)
*   **Key files modified:** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/layout.tsx`

### Step 4 & 5: Polishing the UI with Background Gradients

With the core functionality in place, the focus shifted to visual appeal.

**Prompt:** "Add color gradients to the background to polish the app..." and "add gradients to the login/sign up screens also"

**Summary:**
To create a more modern and engaging user interface, a subtle radial gradient was added to the background. Initially, the effect was too faint. A follow-up refinement adjusted the CSS opacity to make the gradient more prominent but still elegant. This style was applied globally, ensuring a consistent look on the main app page as well as the login and signup screens.

*   **Key file modified:** `src/app/globals.css`

---

### Step 6: Achieving the "Lovable" Background Effect

The final visual touch was to replicate a more complex, textured background style.

**Prompt:** "the gradient i want is more likekly like the one in the pic, like the lovable background"

**Summary:**
The CSS was significantly enhanced to achieve the desired aesthetic:

1.  **Multi-Tone Gradient:** The simple radial gradient was replaced with a more dynamic one, blending a cool blue tone at the top with a warm orange accent at the bottom.
2.  **Noise Texture:** An SVG-based noise filter was applied as an overlay to the background, adding texture and depth that closely mimics the reference image.

This final step gave the application a professional and visually stunning finish.

*   **Key file modified:** `src/app/globals.css`
